	<h1>Where Is Aneurin From?</h1>
	<p>Aneurin Is from Zimotaka, Japan. It’s always busy a city that never sleeps. Everyone is always rushing to get to their job they woke up late for, kids always straggling around dreading school. Nighttime isn’t any better the bright flashing advertisements and billboards on the tall building touching the sky. It’s special to Aneurin because some of her happiest memories is spending time there and exploring with her family.</p>
